# 📝 Event Guest List Manager

Welcome! This is my Week 2 Code Challenge project: a simple **Guest List Manager** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

It allows users to add guests to an event, see them listed on the page, and manage the list easily — all without reloading the browser.

- ✅ Add a guest name using an input field and submit button.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Capture and use form input using JavaScript.
- Add and remove elements dynamically from the page (DOM manipulation).
- Use `event.preventDefault()` to stop form refresh.
- Use `new Date().toLocaleTimeString()` to show time.
- Organize code and structure files clearly.
- Write beginner-friendly and working JavaScript.
